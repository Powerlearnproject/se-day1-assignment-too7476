# SE_Day1
evolution of software engineering.
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.mastering complexity
2.Mastering process
3.Mastering machine
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
2.Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
3.Design - building the framework. 
4.Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
5.Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is  Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on,while    Agile methodologies is  Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles
Waterfall methodology is appropriate when there is Low flexibility,while Agile methodologies is appropriate when  Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
2.reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
3.racking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.rapid technological advancement-  adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
2.Limited Infrastructure-Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
3.Changing Software Requirements-ngineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1.System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
 2.Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.
3.Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
1.Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
2.Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
1'Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
2.Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
3.Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
